# Contributing
Contributions are very welcome -- creating a demo notebook or some documentation is the best way to begin contributing to Iodide!

You can get started by visiting https://iodide-project.github.io/master/ -- from there, you can begin working on a notebook, and export it to your local machine when you're happy with it.

When you have something you want to share, submit a PR to this repo. Before submitting a PR, please ensure that the resource links to the CSS and JS files in your exported notebooks use the URI `https://iodide-project.github.io/master/iodide.master.*`. (Note that if you started working from the link above, you shouldn't have to do anything.

# Suggestions for top-notch notebooks

Iodide is intended to be a low-friction way to communicate complex ideas that require computation, visualization, and/or interaction in order to be explained fully. High-quality notebooks will focus on this *communication* dimension, and will be designed to explain an idea to a reader. A [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) style is strongly encouraged --you should aim to have a narrative arc, and to tell a story to your reader; write prose in addition to code.

"Data journalism" provides some of the very best sources of inspiration. Take a look at sites like www.fivethirtyeight.com, or the mix of visualization and explanation in things like this [interactive piece from the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/28/upshot/what-the-tax-bill-would-look-like-for-25000-middle-class-families.html).

Of course, Iodide is directly inspired by Jupyter, so it's worth checking out http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ as another source of examples.
